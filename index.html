                    Supernatural season 12 will be happening on CW,
                    <br><b class="weight">BUT</b>
                    <br>with a new showrunner. TV Line reports that current showrunner Jeremy Carver is stepping down to focus on Frequency (which was just given a series order). He'll be replaced by the team of Robert Singer and Andrew Dabb.
                    <br><b>Chances are,</b> in the last 10 years you’ve heard of the show Supernatural. Maybe you watched it when it first aired in 2005 but fell off. Maybe you’ve only seen an episode or two with a friend who is obsessed. Or maybe you’ve never seen it at all. Whatever your reason for not being up to date with Supernatural, that needs to change. Supernatural isn’t just a show about supernatural creatures, it deals with family, navigating every day life, and figuring out how to handle what is expected of you; things we can all relate to. This coming Season is much more of a twist and turn.
                    <br> <b>DONT GET LEFT BEHIND ANYMORE!!!</b>.</p>
